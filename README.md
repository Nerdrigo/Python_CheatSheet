# Python Cheat Sheet

This repo is a collection of files with helpful information for different tasks. Most of the functions in the files don't have a specific purpose, they have useful information to start coding without having to search for function names because I don't remember them.

The files accomplish the following

* `SQLhelpers.py` helps create a connection with a database.
* `pdf2txt.py` will transform pdf documents (with text in image format) into plain text files with the help of an OCR software.
* `pdf_reader.py` helps manipulate a PDF file.
* `regex.py` helps with text pre-processing to start working with regular expressions
* `xl_filler.py` helps fill excel sheets
* `xl_reader.py` helps extract information from excel sheets
